# Assignment Overview

### Task 1
Load your employer dataset and make at least 2 observations on the data that you are seeing.

### Task 2
Create the regex for the phone number using all the techniques you learnt during the last session.

### Task 3
Apply all the cleaning techniques on the dataset by using function. Your function will take a string as an input and will return the clean version of it. Create one function per regex + string manipulation you do. Use the apply function of pandas to clean your dataset.

### Task 4
Looking at nltk library:

Create a function to apply at least 2 stemming techniques to the dataset. Which technique do you prefer?

### Task 5
Create a function to apply at least 2 lemmatization techniques to the dataset. Which technique do you prefer? What observation can you make on lemmatization compare to stemming?

### Task 6
Create a function to remove stop words from the corpus of data. Do you think about other words that can be removed based on our use case?

### Task 7
Are you happy about the end result? What observation can you make on the advantages and drawbacks of cleaning using each technique?

### Task 8 (Optional)
Try to create a function to solve mispelling using [this technique](https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html) or just be lazy and use [this repo](https://github.com/barrust/pyspellchecker)
