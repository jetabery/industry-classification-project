Task 1
Generalize all the preprocessing tasks into one single function that can be use in the Vectorizer (passing boolean to make sure that you can activate or deactivate on preprocessing step)

Task 2
Work and research on Hashing Vectorizer. What advantage and disadvantage it gives. Implement it for you project (use TFidf for the rest)

Task 3
Research and create a presentation of the model you have been assign to work on. 

Task 4

Task 6 (Optional)
Create a WordCloud for each cluster predicted by your model
