    "### Observations\n",
    "The dataset contains just two columns: the name of the company (\"employers\") and the description of the company (\"description\"). The \"employers\" column seems straightforward enough, but the \"description\" column is a bit more complicated. It all seems to pertain to the company, but the content of the descriptions seem to vary. For example, the description above starts with an advertisement for the company, but then also includes some kind of review from a former employee who accuses the company of racist and sexist practice. It seems like, often, pieces of information from distinct sources are separated by two or three periods (\"...\")."
